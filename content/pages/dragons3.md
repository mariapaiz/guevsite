Summary: Traditional drawing over paper, graphite, colored pencil and markers.

This is an air dragon, especialized in stealth. His huge yellow eyes glow in the dark at will and are perfect for night vision. He glides gently so he can hunt his favorite meal: sheep. Before the hunt he fills the area with a dark smoke cloud so his victims can't see him coming.
