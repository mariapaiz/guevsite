Summary: Traditional drawing over paper, graphite, colored pencil and markers.

This dragon is an earth dragon. She's very friendly with children but has a particularly feisty temper. When angry, she rolls into a ball of fire, setting ablaze everything in her path. She has a huge soft spot for children though.
