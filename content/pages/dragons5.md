Summary: Traditional drawing over paper, graphite, colored pencil and markers.

This is a male land dragon. He has a really heavy tail that can cause earth shakes. He is so heavy that he can't fly very high up. His tiny wings work much like a helicopter elevating him a few meters up in the air. He can also throw fire balls and fire jets.
