Summary: Traditional drawing over paper, colored pencil and markers.

Naringi is an electric dragon. She is part of a personal project where I set to create a group of dragons with the personalities that matched my group of friends. Each of the dragons has a different skill set and lives on a different habitat. This is the dragon version of me. She has an electric tail and defends herself with lightning bolts.
