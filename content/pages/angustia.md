This painting has a double meaning: protest against violence towards women and symbolical for me. The girl lying there on the ground is actually me (just the hair is modified)...  I was sad when I did it... the inspiration at least came from that. The grave injustices in the world, the way people are mistreated but still the way we fight back. She isn't physically hurt... it's her spirit that's been hurt... but still she's trying to hold on and get back up on her feet.
