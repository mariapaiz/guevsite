        "Working on IP development with Maria was a privilege and a pleasure. Her strong understanding of the foundations of character design and art were cornerstones in our working relationship. Maria's passion and enthusiasm also led to our in-house artists developing skills and ideas which have traditionally been absent from our working environment. She's terrific to work with and a wonderful artist who we'll be happy to come to again."
